Getting-Data Proj
============
  I have already writen some simple annotation in the program, but it has to say a little more about the program.
  First I used the most stupid method to complete the mission. Contribute a dataframe and init the first and second column to be activity and subject,then loop every feature to compute their mean and sd,reshape them to a 180*1 vector,add to the dataframe.
